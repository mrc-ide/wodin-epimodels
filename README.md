# wodin-epimodels

This is the repo for sketching out the initial deployment of the msc course to epimodels.dide.ic.ac.uk; once this is working we'll rewrite it to generally support a set of configurations.

* we need to support multiple configurations easily; for now I've put the configuration in config/msc-idm-2022 to reflect one way we might achieve this practically
